# Todo_list_cli_tool
this is my first attempt at making a cli tool with python or any language I decided to start with a project I did before to stay simple to be able to easily learn the libraries needed for making cli tools with python and then I could move to harder projects
### how to use it:
to add, remove, show tasks all happen by calling an option after running the binary the options are:
- `add`
- `remove`
- `showTask`
<br>
these are the options to use the binary keep in mind that `remove` just marks your task complete, but it is called that because in the code it won't mark it as done rather remove it completely from the list
